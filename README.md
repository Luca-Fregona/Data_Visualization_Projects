This repository contains a curated collection of the advanced laboratory projects developed during the Computer Vision course at National Central University (Taiwan).

The focus of these projects is not just implementation, but the visualization of high-dimensional image data. Each lab demonstrates the practical application of algorithms ranging from basic signal processing (filtering, edge detection) to advanced feature extraction.

Technological Stack:

Languages: Python 3.x

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Image

Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, LaTeX (for documentation)
